      <h3>Proposal For A New Trans Flag &nbsp;&nbsp;( 2020 )</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        A few years ago I had a dream of a trans flag whose colors shifted as endlessly as its form in the wind. A version that spoke both to multiplicity and to the underlying system trans folks traverse. So, in mid 2020 I coded this 2D version, procedurally generated using JavaScript, this flag will infinitely change color in its horizontal bars. While the colors shift, the black and brown triangle portions stay the same, a gesture towards the need to center black and brown trans voices and experiences. This is further emphasized by the middle bar which, one shifted from its starting color, will never return to a pure white. The design draws from the original trans flag, the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Black_trans_flag.svg">Black Trans Flag</a> by Raquel Willis, and the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://progress.gay/">Progress Pride Flag</a> by Daniel Quasar.

      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        A video scans the contours of my body. The video is projected and doubled in space using a two-way mirror commonly used for surveillance and privacy purposes. Installed, the mirror has the effect of both doubling the surveillance of my body and negating its ability to provide privacy to the viewer.

      <h3>The Best Transwoman &nbsp;&nbsp;( 2018 )</h3>
      <div class="projectSlide">
        <img src="../assets/images/projects/misc/best-trans.png" alt="Installation image of The Best Transwoman featuring a video of a throat with hands on it being played inside of a vintage opaque image projector." />

      <br />
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        Focusing on the throat as a charged sight of violence, desire, and gendered identification, this piece draws one into a scene of pressure. By inverting the standard optical mode, as one recedes from the device the image is magnified, one's sense of closeness to the body in question is disrupted.
        <br /><br />
        The phrase ‚ÄúThe best transwoman is an invisible one.‚Äù is repeated throughout the video as my throat is variably caressed and choked.

      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        <i>Trans Effigy 2016</i> used the design form of an official seal to mark each documented case of a trans person being murdered in the U.S.A. in 2016. These designs were used to manufacture wax stamp tools, glass stamp tools and printing plates. These tools were used in the creation of wax seal prints, glass seal facsimiles, and a series of 60 letterpress printed and handbound artist books as well as being displayed as works in their own right. The artist books were porduced as part of the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://artlitlab.org/events/csart-madison-2017">CSArt Madison 2017</a> program organzied by Art Lit Lab.
