      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Through the use of spatial relationships, video, coding, writing, and bookbinding, this art installation places the viewer at the center of a node, a point of convergence that examines the variety of peoples and organizations who
        use/embody/manipulate the term transgender and to what effect. By placing various sources and voices in conversation with one another, the work examines whether any word that seeks to define or describe non-binary gendered embodiment can ever
        really do that or if it instead always fails to contain/apprehend all of itâ€™s own iterations, implications, and complications.
        <br /><br />
        In creating these works with a nonlinear structure in mind, the viewerâ€™s conventional modes of processing of image and text into understandable and digestible narratives are undercut. Placing the viewer in this state allows for the
        multidirectional tensions of the various photo, video, audio, and textual elements and their juxtapositions to be considered without a predeterminable resolution. This system does not inherently construct or destruct meaning but rather gives
        meaningful elements over to a system that may alter meanings based on how they are understood in context.
        <br /><br />
        It is primarily work that is about seeing and being seen as non-passive acts, about teasing out the violence inherent in systemic and dehumanizing methods of categorizations, about empathizing and dissociation, about the thresholds and
        portals between things, and about the bodies (mine) that are caught amongst it all.
