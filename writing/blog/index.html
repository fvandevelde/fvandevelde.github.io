          For a long time now, I have been skeptical of the benefits of visibility or at the very least I have been leery about the personal costs of being visible as a trans person. When I talk about this hestiance, (non-trans) people tend to assume it is because of lingering...

          I have heard a lot of talk in art departments and on campuses in general about teaching "digital skills" or "digital literacy", whether it is necessary, what it entails, how to standardize it, and etc..
